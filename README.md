vistrails-dataone
=================

vistrails-dataone is a VisTrails package that allows users to ingest and publish data to the DataONE infrastructure.  It is currently very preliminary work so be aware that it is likely not very robust right now.

To use it, please make sure you have installed VisTrails v2.0 or higher (see www.vistrails.org).  Install the package by cloning it into your ~/.vistrails/userpackages directory, and enable it using VisTrails' package manager (accessed via the Preferences panel).
